Hi! I'm Mert, and this is my blog atleast it should be... I am a computer programmer and undergraduate Software Engineer as of 2014. I am fluent in C, C++, Java and Bash.
And yes I am a Linux user, actually power-user, and sysadmin little bit... I like to compile my own kernel with my own config, use my own Desktop-Environment also with custom Development-Environment... These are some specialties that seperates me from any other ordinary people as Software guy, and seperates me from any other software guy who had heard of Linux...

	The projects I did since I was born are various but not really significant... Some of are:
-> instx: slax install script, also allows any linux distro to install to your hdd or copy it when it's alive!
-> primenums: the prime number walker, counts to infinity and finds new primenumbers... I developed algorithm and method of that program...
-> Library_DB: a Java 'Library' tool that allows user to register new book or change existing one within single basic pane.
-> phy100*: projects that starting with phy are the methods and calculations I did in physics labrotary... I am lazy and I wrote basic apps for them. For example of taking average from unknown number of items...
-> etc. (i am lazy)
