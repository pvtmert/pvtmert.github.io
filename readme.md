Blog and a homepage for myself...
-----

I created this pages to write my ideas and I don't want to
host my site on my computer...
(Because my original 'host' burned and I'm hosting from netbook,
I am carrying this to everywhere so site's uptime is nearly zero.)

I already had github and have been seeing .github.io pages since '13 Q3,
decided to create one to test and manage... (I am n00b for instance.)

#### So why are you adding README?
1. See how Markdown works.
2. To stop git complaining about it.
3. etc...

#### Why don't you get some hosting and domain service from some provider?
1. I am lazy,
2. I will broke entire server,
3. I going to mess up so bad that they will need Gats & Torvalds cooperation to fix them up.

#### Please remove fkng effects
* NO.
* USE LYNX OR LINKS OR W3M OR WHATEVER FOR THAT.
* You can use style formatting = none if using firefox or equalivent for chrome.

#### Internet Explorer...
I dont care what IE is or what it does. Just dont use it.
