<p>an unmanned, serial file transferring, without interrupting network connection is important... especially in turkey, there is some limit one limitless-connection or limitless-package of ISP's</p>

<p>such that, limit is 50gb per installation, so if you exceed that limit your network speed gets decreased to 3mbps, normal speed can be from 8mbps to 100mbps depending of your set-up.</p>

<p>this protocol leaves socket open while 'all' of the files being sent... so that speed drop wont be noticable since they calculating and assigning new one for new connection...</p>

<p>this is barely-known bug of general service... actually this does not affect a lot of users because standard requests of browsing are generally opens and closes socket after work is done, they requests other pages, iframes and such in new connection...</p>

<p>the protocol is written in c and can be accessible for everyone at:
